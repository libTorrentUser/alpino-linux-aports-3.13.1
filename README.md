Alpino Linux aports repository
==============================

This is a fork of the official Alpine Linux aports repository. The sole intent of this fork is to allow users to add initialization scripts to custom Alpine Linux ISOs.

The initialization scripts can do pretty much anything you want, so you can have customized Live Alpine Linux that sets up the system just after you boot it.
